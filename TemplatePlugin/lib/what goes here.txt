You'll need these two files in this folder to get building working.

1) Assembly-CSharp.dll

You can find this file in the game files. You can get to the game files by right-click the game in Steam and selecting `Manage` -> `Browse local files`. The file is located in the `Slipstream_Win_Data/Managed` folder.

2) com.mosadie.mocore.dll

You can grab the latest MoCore dll from https://github.com/mosadie/MoCore/releases/latest


If you want to add any additional libraries the game uses, you can do the following:

- Put the relevant .dll in this folder.
- Add the .dll to the .gitignore file in this folder.
- Add the .dll to the .csproj file, use the existing entries as a template.
